My fifth Odin project - Calculator

Assignment overview:

I made it! By now I should have a really firm grasp on the fundamentals of JavaScript. Of course there’s plenty more to learn, but I should be able to create quite a bit at this point. My final Foundations Course project is going to combine everything I’ve learned so far: I'm going to make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
